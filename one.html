            <h2 id="physics">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Starting the Gym might seem overwhelming; therefore, I wanted to create a guide to help you
              through the journey. There are many benefits gained from going to the Gym, such as; improving your
              overall health, strength, stability, muscle coordination, and cognitive health (improved memory,
              concentration, and mental sharpness). This guide aims to be a foundation for you to build upon.
              You need to be conscious of a defined end goal (The person you want to be at the end of the
              transformation). Due to the society that we live in, people are becoming increasingly inactive.
              Therefore, we need to take time out of our day to get the necessary amount of exercise. The body is
              excellent at adapting; if you apply resistance, it will grow. This applies to most areas of people’s
              lives.
              I
              think a lot of people underestimate the capabilities of their bodies. Invest in yourself.
              Having a clear and objective goal is essential. What is the result you are looking for? Is it losing
              Weight? Gain muscle, and in what areas? These are important to think about to achieve the best
              outcome from the Gym. The most IMPORTANT thing is to be consistent; 3 to 4 times a week in the
              Gym, with an improved diet, is more than enough to achieve your goals.

              Having a journal can help you keep track during your fitness journey. You can write the number of
              sets, workouts, and other daily tasks. Here are some great journals that I use:

            <ol>
              <li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3UDGwAC">Leuchtturm1917 - Personal favourite ♥</a></strong> </li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3XY536p"> Quo Vadis Habana</a></strong> </li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3uy29aW">Moleskine Pocket</a></strong> </li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3uy29aW">Cambridge Notebook</a></strong> </li>
            </ol>



            </p>
            <h2 id="physics">Calories</h2>
            <p>Tracking your calories can be daunting, but the benefit is enormous. It starts by understanding the
              number of calories you intake and how often you are active. The more active you are, the higher the
              calories are needed; vice versa, the less active you are, the fewer calories are required. If you are
              trying
              to lose weight, try a deficit of 300cal in your first month and then move to a 500cal deficit. Doing an
              extreme deficit could lead to an effect on your metabolism. The body will start to hold on to fat as a
              means of a panic response. Therefore, you need to see what deficit works best for your body.

              Here are three things that can help you understand and track your calories:
            <ol>
              <li><strong><a href="https://tdeecalculator.net/"> TDEE Calculator</a></strong> - Use the TDEE calculator
                to
                learn your
                Total Daily Energy Expenditure, a
                measure of how many calories you burn per day. This calorie calculator will also display your
                BMI, BMR, Macros & many other useful statistics!</li>
              <li><strong><a
                    href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7gGXXQIy4R4ejRRNkZHZHFDOW8/view?resourcekey=0-6D2ColRi_grLWCiE63F0MA">TDEE
                    Spreadsheet (DOWNLOAD!!)</strong> </a> This can help you attain your desired body weight by
                calculating the calories you need to be in a deficit per day. Plug in your weight and calories on
                the sheet every day.</li>

            </ol>

            <h2 id="physics">Food</h2>
            <p>I can have a different pdf for food, so I’ll keep it short here. Try your best to adhere to eating good
              food and avoiding/maintaining others. Going out of your way and creating your meal plans may seem
              time-consuming, but it is advantageous.

              Examples of some good food/ food to moderate:
            <ol>
              <li>Chicken</li>
              <li>Tuna</li>
              <li>Eggs</li>
              <li>Avocados</li>
              <li>Prodigy</li>
              <li>Yogurt</li>
              <li>Drink more water</li>
              <li>Avoid junk food</li>
              <li>Avoid juices (high cal)</li>
              <li>Avoid mayo</li>
              <li>Moderate when adding oil</li>
              <li>Food containing a high degree of fat (especially
                saturated fat)</li>

            </ol>
            </p>
            <h2 id="physics">How to build muscle</h2>
            <p>It is better to use the machines for a beginner as it removes the need for you to have good form.
              Example of how to use the machines: <strong><a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pW4H5qwTXZU">1</a></strong> <strong><a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiJKa41Fsxo">2</a></strong>
            </p>
            <p>The advantage of using free weights is better mind-to-muscle connection and muscle stability. BOTH
              ARE GOOD, and sometimes combining them is better.</p>
